Lab Scripts
---
Setting up account sand activating mailboxes can be a pain.  I use the scripts here to auto import my Lab Accounts and to enable the mailboxes in Exchange 2013.

I recommend using the Sample accounts CSV with the import.
!IMPORTANT! The mailbox enable text needs to be copied and pasted into Powershell.  I could get pipe to work.  BUt you only run it once so it wasn;t worht the effort to troubleshout.

If you need email to import into accounts for Archive or E-discovery testing I recommend you search for the Enron Email vorpus and use in conjunction with the Enron user and mailbox activiation scripts.
